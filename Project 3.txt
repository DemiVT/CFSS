1. Introduction to Flipper Zero
Task: Research and use Flipper Zero to explore its features. If the physical device isn't available, study its functionalities through documentation and simulate tasks using related tools.

Key Features:
NFC Emulation: Read and clone NFC cards.
RFID Communication: Read, store, and emulate RFID tags.
Bluetooth and IR control: Control devices through IR and Bluetooth.
Sub-GHz communication: Interact with devices using the Sub-GHz spectrum.
Research Material:

Visit the official Flipper Zero Documentation.
2. Cybersecurity Applications
Task 1: NFC and RFID Card Emulation
Scenario: Perform NFC/RFID cloning.
Steps:

Use the NFC module in Flipper Zero to scan an NFC card (if available).
Store the NFC data.
Emulate the NFC card using Flipper Zero.
bash
Copy code
# Emulating an NFC card (Using Python or pseudo code)
import nfc
import time

def read_nfc_card():
    print("Hold NFC card near reader...")
    with nfc.ContactlessFrontend('usb') as clf:
        tag = clf.connect(rdwr={'on-connect': lambda tag: False})
        print("Card Data:", tag)

def emulate_nfc_card(card_data):
    print("Emulating NFC card...")
    while True:
        time.sleep(5)
        print(f"Emulating: {card_data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    card_data = read_nfc_card()
    emulate_nfc_card(card_data)
Countermeasure Research:

Study how NFC encryption can improve security and why weak encryption leads to vulnerabilities.
Task 2: Bluetooth Device Scanning
Scenario: Use Flipper Zero or any Bluetooth scanner to scan for nearby devices and check for vulnerabilities.
bash
Copy code
# Linux Command to scan for Bluetooth devices
sudo hcitool scan

# Capture the device details and document them
sudo bt-device --list
Steps:

Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices.
Document the information gathered (device name, MAC address).
Check for open ports using tools like nmap.
bash
Copy code
# Scanning a Bluetooth device for open ports
sudo nmap -sV -p- <device_IP>
Countermeasure Research:

Investigate Bluetooth security protocols (e.g., pairing methods, encryption) and vulnerabilities (e.g., Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing).
3. Technology Overview: Communication Interfaces (NFC, RFID, Bluetooth)
Task 3: Understanding and Capturing RFID Tags
Scenario: Use Flipper Zero or another RFID tool to capture and emulate RFID data.
Python Program (Pseudo-code example):

python
Copy code
# Sample code for capturing and decoding RFID (simulation)
import rfid_reader

def capture_rfid_data():
    rfid_data = rfid_reader.read()
    print("Captured RFID:", rfid_data)
    return rfid_data

def emulate_rfid(rfid_data):
    print("Emulating RFID data...")
    # Emulate captured RFID signal
    while True:
        print(f"Sending RFID: {rfid_data}")
        time.sleep(2)

rfid_data = capture_rfid_data()
emulate_rfid(rfid_data)
Steps:

Use Flipper Zero to capture RFID data from tags.
Store and emulate the captured data.
Research the vulnerabilities of RFID systems.
4. Use Cases in Cybersecurity
Task 4: Real-World Penetration Testing with NFC/RFID
Scenario: Apply Flipper Zero to test vulnerabilities in NFC-based access systems.
Research:
Investigate real-world use cases where NFC/RFID vulnerabilities were exploited.
Document findings and research how Flipper Zero can enhance penetration testing.
Research Source: Flipper Zero GitHub Community.

5. Advantages and Limitations of Flipper Zero
Task 5: Analyze Advantages and Limitations
Scenario: Write a report on Flipper Zeroâ€™s strengths and weaknesses in cybersecurity, specifically in terms of legality, device range, and compatibility with real-world hacking tools.
Advantages:

Versatile Tool: Supports multiple protocols (NFC, RFID, Bluetooth, IR).
Portable and Easy to Use: Small size and simple interface.
Multi-purpose Use: Great for educational purposes and hands-on learning.
Limitations:

Limited Range: Short-range for some wireless protocols.
Legal Concerns: Unauthorized NFC/RFID reading can breach privacy laws.
Compatibility Issues: Limited to certain devices and protocols.
Task:

Document how these advantages and limitations affect real-world cybersecurity applications.
Propose strategies to work around these limitations.
6. Documentation and Presentation
Final Task: Research Documentation & Presentation Preparation
Document All Tasks: Prepare a report with detailed steps for NFC/RFID scanning, Bluetooth device scanning, and potential use cases.
Create a Presentation: Summarize your findings and showcase use cases where Flipper Zero is applied in penetration testing, including its ethical considerations.
